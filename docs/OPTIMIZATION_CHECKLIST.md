## üîß Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Bundle analysis (if configured)
npm run analyze

## üìà Monitoring

### Real User Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Track page load times
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Set up performance alerts

### Analytics
- [ ] Track bounce rates
- [ ] Monitor conversion rates
- [ ] Analyze user flows
- [ ] Track engagement metrics
- [ ] Monitor mobile vs desktop

## üêõ Known Issues (Pre-Existing)

These existed before optimization:
- TypeScript errors for `ion-icon` elements
- Some business data type inconsistencies
- Minor type issues in DynamicAnimations

**None of these affect runtime performance or user experience.**

## üìù Next Optimization Opportunities

### Low Priority (Future)
1. Add service worker for offline support
2. Implement route prefetching on hover
3. Add image CDN (Cloudflare/Vercel)
4. Optimize API request caching
5. Implement partial hydration
6. Add brotli compression
7. Set up performance budgets in CI

### Nice to Have
