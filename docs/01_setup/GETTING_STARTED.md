# Getting Started with KLIO

This guide will help you get up and running with KLIO in your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** for version control
- **Supabase** account (for backend services)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd KLIO
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your configuration:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Optional: Overpass API (for business data seeding)
NEXT_PUBLIC_OVERPASS_API_URL=https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the database migrations in order:

1. Navigate to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run migrations from `src/app/lib/migrations/` in order:
   - Start with `001_core/`
   - Then `002_business/`
   - Then `003_reviews/`
   - Then `004_storage/`
   - Finally `005_functions/`

See [Migration README](../../src/app/lib/migrations/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`

- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`

### Database Issues

- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Check that migrations have been run in order
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

### Environment Variables

- Ensure all required variables are set in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after changing environment variables
- Don't commit `.env.local` to version control

## Next Steps
