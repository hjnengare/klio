# Cursor Rules

## Scope
All edits, suggestions, and generated code must prioritize **mobile devices only**.

## Guidelines
- Assume the viewport width ≤ 768px unless otherwise stated.
- Do not implement or adjust desktop, tablet, or large-screen layouts.
- When adding CSS or Tailwind styles, always optimize for mobile responsiveness first.
- Use mobile-first approaches such as `flex`, `grid`, and `w-full` layouts.
- Avoid hover-only states; rely on touch-friendly interactions.
- Navigation, modals, and forms must be tested for usability on small screens.
- Ignore breakpoints above `md:` unless absolutely necessary for mobile stability.
- If layout conflicts arise, default to **mobile simplicity** (stacked, single-column, minimal padding).
